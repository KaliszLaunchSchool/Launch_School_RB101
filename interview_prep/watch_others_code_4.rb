The maximum sum subarray problem consists of finding the maximum sum of 
a contiguous subsequence in an array of integers.

Example:
max_sequence([-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]) == 6 #=> [4, -1, 2, 1]

The easy case is when the array is made up of only positive numbers and the 
maximum sum is the sum of the whole array. If the array is made up of 
negative numbers, return 0 instead. 

An empty array is considered to have zero greatest sum. Note that the empty 
array is also a valid subarray

p max_sequence([]) == 0
p max_sequence([-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]) == 6
p max_sequence([11]) == 11
p max_sequence([-32]) == 0
p max_sequence([-2, 1, -7, 4, -10, 2, 1, 5, 4]) == 12
