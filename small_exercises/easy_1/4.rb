Write a method that counts the number of occurrences of each element in a given array.

vehicles = [
  'car', 'car', 'truck', 'car', 'SUV', 'truck',
  'motorcycle', 'motorcycle', 'car', 'truck'
]

count_occurrences(vehicles)

The words in the array are case-sensitive: 'suv' != 'SUV'. ` Once counted, print each element 
alongside the number of occurrences.

Expected output:

car => 4
truck => 3
SUV => 1
motorcycle => 2

## Problem ##
- Create a method
- Given an array of elements
- Count the number of elements in an array
- Print each element along side the number of occurences
- Case matters 'suv' != 'SUV'

Input: Array
Output: Hash

## Example ##
vehicles = [
  'car', 'car', 'truck', 'car', 'SUV', 'truck',
  'motorcycle', 'motorcycle', 'car', 'truck'
]

Expected output:
car => 4
truck => 3
SUV => 1
motorcycle => 2

## Data ##
Array
Strings(or other elements?) within the array
Integer
Hash
